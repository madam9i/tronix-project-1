Linux Commands
+++++++++++++++

$ whoami : It will display currently logged in username (default: aureuser)

$ sudo -i (to convert the aureuser to root user)
-> a special user with unlimited access to all files, programs, and resources on the system.
-> The root user has a user ID (UID) of 0, which is the highest level of permissions available.
-> The root user's home directory is /root.

$ pwd : Present Working Directory

$ date : To display current date

$ sudo (superuser do)
->  It allows regular users to run privileged commands, such as installing or updating packages, disabling network interfaces, and restarting the system.

$ ps -aux : To Display the information about a selection of active processes


-> In Linux everything  will be represented as a file

-> We have 3 types of files in linux

1) Ordinary File / Normal File  (it will start with -) - white color
2) Directory File  (it will start with d) - blue color
3) Link File (it will start with l)

-> The file which contains data is called as ordinary file

-> Directory file is equal to folder (it can contain files and folders)

-> The file which is having linking is called as Link File 

-------------------------------------------------
=> touch : it is used to create empty file

		//write data
		press CTRL + d (to save and exit)

		$ cat hello.txt   (To display file data)

		$ cat >> hello.txt (To append data in the file)
		//write data
		press CTRL + d (to save and exit)

-> To display file content we will use 'cat' command

		$ cat filename

-> To display file content with line numbers we will use '-n' option

		$ cat -n filename


-> To display multiple files content at a time execute command like below

		$ cat file1 file2 file3

-> Copy one file data into another file using 'cat' command

		$ cat f1.txt > f8.txt

-> Copy more than one file data into another file

		$ cat f1.txt f2.txt > f9.txt

-> To create directory we will use 'mkdir' command

		$ mkdir dirname

-> To remove the file we will use 'rm' command

		$ rm filename

-> To remove empty directory we will use 'rmdir' command

		$ rmdir dirname

-> To display content of given directory we can execute like below

		$ ls <dirname>

-> To delete empty directory we will use 'rmdir' command

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> 'ls' is used to list out all files & directories available in the given directory

Note: we can pass several options for 'ls' commands

-> ls : It will display all files in alphabetical order (a to z)

-> ls -r : It will display all files in reverse of alphabetical order (z to a)

-> ls -l : It will display long listing of files

-> ls -t : It will display all files based on last modified date and time. Most recent file will be display at top and old files will display at bottom.

-> ls -rt : It will display all files based on reverse of last modified date and time. Old files will display at top and recent files will display bottom.


-> ls -a : It will display all files including hidden files (hidden files will start with .)

-> ls -li : It will display files with inode.

-> ls -lR : It will display all files and directories along with sub directoris content

	Note: -R represents recursive

Note:  We can use several options for ls command at a time. When we are using multiple options order of the options is not important

		$ ls -ltr
		$ ls -tlr
		$ ls -l -t -r
		$ ls -trl

Note: All the above commands will give same output


Reversing File Content
----------------------
-> 'tac' command is used to reverse file content

	$ tac filename

-> 'rev' command is used to reverse each line content of the file

	$ rev filename


head command
-------------
cd /var/log
ls -l
cat filename

-> head command is used to display file data from top (default 10 lines)

		$ head filename
		$ head -n 5 syslog  (first 5 lines data)
		$ head -n 20 syslog (first 20 lines data)


tail command
-------------
-> tail command is used to display file data from bottom (default 10 lines)

		$ tail filename (last 10 lines data)
		$ tail -n 100 filename (last 100 lines data)
	
		$ tail +25 filename (it will display data from 25th line to bottom)
		

Note: To see on-growing logs we can use '-f' option

		$ tail -f data.log   (Live log message we can see)


wc (word count) command
-----------
-> It is used to count no.of lines, no.of words and no.of characters in the file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When application running, it will generate log messages and it will store log messages at bottom of the file.


-> To see log messages of the application we will use 'tail' command


cp command
---------
-> To copy the data from one file to another file

	$ cp one.txt two.txt  ( or ) $ cat one.txt > two.txt

	$ cp f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt  (invalid syntax)

cp (source path) target path

cp /opt/build-deploy/target/web-application-war-file.war /opt/tomcat/webapps

-> We can't copy morethan one file data using 'cp' command. To copy multiple files data we should go for 'cat' command

	$ cat f1.txt f2.txt > f3.txt

Rename the files or directories
--------------------------------
-> To rename files we will use 'mv' command

	$ mv f1.txt f1111.txt

	$ mv  dirname dirnewname

Note: We can use 'mv' command for renaming and moving files

Comparing files
---------------
-> To compare files we can use below commands

$ cmp f1.txt f2.txt
$ diff f1.txt f2.txt

-> cmp command will display only first difference in given 2 two files
-> diff command will display all the differences in the content

grep command
------------
-> 'grep' stands for global regular expression print.

-> 'grep' command will process the text line by line and prints any lines which matches given pattern.

	Ex: I want to print all lines which contains 'NullPointerException'

	$ grep -i 'NullPointerException' *

Note: We can install grep using below command

	$ sudo apt install grep

//search for the lines which contains given word in the given filename
$ grep 'word' filename

//search for the lines which are having exception keyword in server.log file
$ grep -i 'exception' server.log 

//search for the given text in present directory and in sub-directories also
$ grep -R 'exception'

=> We can pass several options for 'grep' command

-c : This prints only the count of files that matches give pattern

-i : ignore case-sentitivty

-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers

-l : Displays only file names that matches the pattern

-h : Displays matched lines without file names

-R : Displays matched lines with file names

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Working with Text Editors in Linux
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> The default editor that comes with the LNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor). 

-> Using vi editor, we can edit an existing file or we create a new file from scratch

-> We can also use this vi editor to just read a text file.


Modes of Operation in vi editor 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are three modes of operations in vi:

1) command mode
2) insert mode (press I)
3) escape mode


++++++++++++++++
Command Mode: 
+++++++++++++++

When vi starts up, it is in Command Mode. This mode is where vi interprets any characters we type as commands and thus does not display them in the window

This mode allows us to move through a file, and to delete, copy, or paste a piece of text.

To enter into Command Mode from any other mode, it requires pressing the [Esc] key. If we press [Esc] when we are already in Command Mode, then vi will beep or flash the screen.

+++++++++++++++
Insert mode: 
+++++++++++++++

This mode enables you to insert text into the file. 

Everything thatâ€™s typed in this mode is interpreted as input and finally, it is put in the file. 

The vi always starts in command mode. To enter text, you must be in insert mode.

To come in insert mode you simply type i. 
 
To get out of insert mode, press the Esc key, which will put you back into command mode.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Last Line Mode (Escape Mode): 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Line Mode is invoked by typing a colon [:], while vi is in Command Mode. 

The cursor will jump to the last line of the screen and vi will wait for a command. 

This mode enables you to perform tasks such as saving files, executing commands.

There are following way you can start using vi editor :

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Commands and their Description
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

vi filename: Creates a new file if it already not exist, otherwise opens existing file.

vi -R filename : Opens an existing file in read only mode.

view filename : Opens an existing file in read only mode.


$ vi f1.txt

=> After making changes if we  want to save those changes then execute :wq

=> After making changes if we don't want to save those changes then execute :q!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Moving within a File(Navigation):
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To move around within a file without affecting text must be in command mode (press Esc twice). Here are some of the commands can be used to move around one character at a time.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Commands and their Description
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

k : Moves the cursor up one line.
j : Moves the cursor down one line.
h : Moves the cursor to the left one character position.
l : Moves the cursor to the right one character position.
0 or | : Positions cursor at beginning of line.
$ : Positions cursor at end of line.
W : Positions cursor to the next word.
B : Positions cursor to previous word.
( : Positions cursor to beginning of current sentence.
) : Positions cursor to beginning of next sentence.
H : Move to top of screen.
nH : Moves to nth line from the top of the screen.
M : Move to middle of screen.
L : Move to bottom of screen.
nL : Moves to nth line from the bottom of the screen.
colon along with x : Colon followed by a number would position the cursor on line number represented by x.


Usecase
++++++++++
-> We will use 'vi' editor to perform below activities

a) To edit config files of our application
b) To edit shell script files


++++++++++++++++++++++++
Working with SED command
++++++++++++++++++++++++

SED command in LNIX stands for "stream editor" and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.

Though most common use of SED command in LNIX is for substitution or for find and replace. 

By using SED you can edit files even without opening them, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.

SED is a powerful text stream editor. Can do insertion, deletion, search and replace (substitution).

SED command in lnix supports regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.

Example:
---------------
$ cat > myfile.txt
unix is great os. 
unix is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.
unix linux which one you choose.
unix is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os. Learn unix. unix is a powerful.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Replacing or substituting string : 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file. The below simple sed command replaces the word â€œunixâ€ with â€œlinuxâ€ in the file

$ sed 's/unix/linux/' myfile.txt

By default, the sed command replaces the first occurrence of the pattern in each line and it wonâ€™t replace the second, thirdâ€¦occurrence in the line.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line : 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line. The below command replaces the second occurrence of the word â€œunixâ€ with â€œlinuxâ€ in a line.

		$sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line : 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.

		$ sed 's/unix/linux/g' myfile.txt

Deleting lines from a particular file 
-------------------------------------------------
SED command can also be used for deleting lines from a particular file. SED command is used for performing deletion operation without even opening the file

To Delete a particular line say n in this example
-----------------------------------------------------------------
$ sed '5d' myfile.txt

-> To Delete a last line : $ sed '$d' myfile.txt

-> To Delete from nth to last line : $ sed '12,$d' myfile.txt


Note: By default SED command changes will not store in file.

=> To make SED command changes to file permanently we will use '-i' option.

	$ sed -i 's/unix/linux/g' myfile.txt  

Note: With above command 'unix' keyword will be replaced with 'linux' keyword in the file permanently.

==> To delete all the line in file permenently

       $ sed -i '1,$d' myfile.txt  -- all the content deleted permenently

+++++++++++++++
File permissions
+++++++++++++++

To create a secure environment in Linux, you need to learn about user groups and permissions. For example, if you work in a company and you want the finance department to read a file but not make any modification to it, then you need to use permissions in Linux. It is a must for every programmer working with Linux nowadays.

Letâ€™s start by talking about the ownership of Linux files.

User: the owner of the file (person who created the file).

Group: the group can contain multiple users. 

Therefore, all users in that group will have the same permissions. It makes things easier than assign permission for every user you want.

Other: any person has access to that file, that person has neither created the file, nor are they in any group which has access to that file.

=> Execute 'ls -l' command to file's permissions


We will work with this part â€œ-rw-râ€“râ€“".

The characters mean:

â€˜râ€™ = read.
â€˜wâ€™ = write.
â€˜xâ€™ = execute.
â€˜-â€™ = no permission.

-rw-r--r-- --- read write permissions

-: It represents file
rw: User
r: Group
r: Other

As we see above, the empty first part means that it is a file. If it were a directory then it will be the letter â€œdâ€ instead. 

The second part means that the user â€œHomeâ€ has read and write permissions but he does not have the execute one.

The group and others have only the read permission.

Letâ€™s change the permissions using the chmod command.

	$ chmod o+w section.txt

This command will add the write permission for other users to my text file â€œsection.txtâ€.

Now if you try to execute ls -l then you will see -rw-r--rw-

â€œoâ€ refers to others, â€œgâ€ for the group, â€œuâ€ for the user, and â€œaâ€ for all.

Now letâ€™s add the execute permission to the user with:

	$ chmod u+x section.txt

The permissions will be -rwxr--rw-

If you want to remove the permission, you can use the same method but with â€œ-â€ instead of â€œ+â€. 

For example, letâ€™s remove the execute permission from the user by:

	$ chmod u-x section.txt

And the permissions now are: -rw-r--rw-

Also, you can use Symbolic Mode to modify permissions like the following:

Number	Permission
0	No permission
1	Execute
2	Write
3	Execute and Write
4	Read
5	Read and Execute
6	Read and Write
7	Read, Write and Execute

For example, letâ€™s give every permission for all with:

	$ chmod 777 section.txt

Then the permissions will be: -rwxrwxrwx.

Letâ€™s remove the execute from the group and the write from other by:

	$ chmod 765 section.txt
		
Then the permission will be : -rwxrw-r-x

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Working with User Accounts
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

=> Linux is multi user based operating systems

=> Within one Linux machine we can create multiple user accounts

=> Multiple users can access single linux machine and can perform multi-tasking

-> When we launch EC2 instance with Ubuntu OS, we got by default 'ubuntu' user account

Create a user
+++++++++++++
$ sudo adduser <uname>

=> After creating user account we can verify useraccount details using 'id' command

$ id <uname>

=> 'id' command will display user account information

=> Check the files available in home directory 

$ ls -l

	(We can see ubuntu folder and newly created user folder)
	(That means we have 2 user accounts in our machine)

After creating a new user and setting a password to it, you can log in from the terminal

	$ su - <uname>


Delete a user
+++++++++++++

$ sudo userdel <uname>

If you try that command, you will notice that the user directory has not been deleted and you need to delete it by yourself.

You can use this automated command to do everything for you:

$ sudo deluser --remove-home <uname>


User groups
++++++++++++

-> A group is a collection of users. 

-> The primary purpose of the groups is to define a set of privileges like read, write, or execute permission for a given resource that can be shared among the users within the group.

Create a group
++++++++++++++
You can see all of the groups you have by opening the following file:

$ cat /etc/group

Working with 'find' and 'locate' commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

locate command
++++++++++++++++
The locate Command find will search for data in local db

$ sudo apt install mlocate

$ locate apache

$ locate -c apache

$ locate -c *.txt

$ locate -S (to see locate database)

Note: when we create new files it will take some time to update those files in mlocate db

find command
+++++++++++++

=> find command will search for the files in entire linux file system.
=> find command providing advanced searching technique
=> Using find command, we can search for the files based on name and type also.

2. Find Files Under Home Directory
# find /home -name f1.txt

7. Find Files With 777 Permissions
# find . -type f -perm 0777 -print

19. Find all Empty Files
# find /home -type f -empty

20. Find all Empty Directories
# find /home -type d -empty

Note: As find command is scanning entire file system, it will take more time to give search results.


Chown command
++++++++++++++++

-> The chown command changes user ownership of a file & directory in Linux

-> Every file is associated with an owning user or group

-> We can check the ownership of a file using 'ls -l'

# changing owner of a file
$ chown NewUser FILE

Note: we can change owner using userid also

$ chown 1001 filename

# changing group of a file
$ chown :NewGroup FILE

# We can change group using group id also
$ chown :1003 sample

# Change Owner and the Group
$ chown NewUser:NewGroup FILE



-> 'man' command is like a help command. It is used to understand command syntax and options.

		$ man cat


-> To see ip address we will use 'ifconfig' command

	$ ifconfig

Note : ifconfig is not installed then execute below command

	$ sudo apt install net-tools

-> 'ping' command is used to check connectivity

	$ ping <ip>

->  'curl' command is used to get response from the server

	$ curl <url>

-> 'wget' command is used to download resources from internet

	$ wget <url>

How to intall Softwares in Linux Machine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> In linux we have package manager to install a software


Note: Amazon Linux / CentOS / Red Hat : yum is the package manager

Note : Ubuntu : apt-get is the package manager


# update existing packages in linux
$ sudo yum update -y (Amazon Linux / CentOS / Red Hat)
$ sudo apt-get update -y (ubuntu)

# install git client (devops tool)
$ sudo yum install git ((Amazon Linux / CentOS / Red Hat))
$ sudo apt install git -y 

# check git version
$ git --version

# install maven (devops tool)
$ cd /opt/
$ sudo yum install maven
$ sudo apt install maven -y
$ mvn -v 

# check maven version
$ mvn --version

# install java software
$ sudo yum install java
$ sudo apt install java (not worked)
$ sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y 

# install Java 1.8 version
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
$ java --version
